# totfiles 

## tyler's dotfiles

### vim 

what's checked in is a copy sans the plugged dir of `homesick clone git://github.com/technicalpickles/pickled-vim.git`

+ .vimrc, which should/can be .vimrc.local

# the rest

- vscode stuff is a gist 
- symbolically link the files here (ln -s) to your dropbox et voil√†...
- only checked in this homeshick in case of change { so good, it is }, you should download homeshick & clone it etc.
